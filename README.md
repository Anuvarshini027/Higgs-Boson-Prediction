This app has been deployed on streamlit. To view the app check the link below <br>
https://share.streamlit.io/anuvarshini027/higgs-boson-prediction/main/App_Higgs_Boson.py

## Streamlit web app implementation of the project. 

## Pre-requisites :

Make sure to install streamlit if haven't already, to install streamlit use the following command :

```
pip install streamlit
```
All the package requirements have been mentioned in the requirements.txt file. 

## Using Anaconda Prompt:

To run the app in anaconda prompt, go to the location where the higgs_boson_DL.py file is using the cd command and then run the following line:

```
streamlit run higgs_boson_DL.py
```
## Step-by-Step Approach:

 -Data Analysis<br>
 -Data Cleaning<br>
 -Data Pre-Processing<br>
 -Feature Selection (Using Univariate Feature Selection Method)<br>
 -Data Splitting(training and testing data)<br>
 -Performing data on various DEEP LEARNING Models<br>
 -Evaluating Models

## DEEP LEARNING MODELS USED IN THIS PROJECT:

1) Basic ANN
2) Recurrent Neural Network
3) LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)
4) GRU+LSTM(A Hybrid Model)
